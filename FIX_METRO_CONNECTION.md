# Fix for Metro Bundler Connection Error

## Problem
"Could not connect to development server" - The app couldn't connect to Metro bundler on port 8081.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Started Metro Bundler
- Cleared any existing Metro processes
- Started Metro bundler with `--reset-cache` flag
- Verified it's running on port 8081

### 2. Verified Connection
- Metro bundler is accessible at `http://localhost:8081`
- Status: `packager-status:running`

## Current Status

âœ… **Metro bundler is running and ready**

The app is currently building and should automatically connect once the build completes.

## If You Still See the Error

### Option 1: Reload the App
1. Shake your device/simulator (or press `Cmd + D` in simulator)
2. Tap "Reload" in the developer menu

### Option 2: Manual Connection
1. Make sure Metro bundler is running:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/timiajeigbe/Documents/echoID/EchoID
   npx react-native start
   ```

2. In another terminal, rebuild the app:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/timiajeigbe/Documents/echoID/EchoID
   npx react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone 15"
   ```

### Option 3: Check Network Settings
If using a physical device:
- Ensure device and computer are on the same WiFi network
- Check that firewall isn't blocking port 8081
- Try accessing `http://[your-computer-ip]:8081` from the device

## Verification

You should see:
- Metro bundler terminal showing bundle requests
- App loading successfully on simulator/device
- No connection errors in the app

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Start Metro bundler
cd /Users/timiajeigbe/Documents/echoID/EchoID
npx react-native start --reset-cache

# Rebuild and run (in another terminal)
cd /Users/timiajeigbe/Documents/echoID/EchoID
npx react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone 15"
```

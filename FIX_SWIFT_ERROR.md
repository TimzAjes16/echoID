# Fix for Swift DispatchQueue Error

## Error
"Trailing closure passed to parameter of type 'DispatchWorkItem' that does not accept..."

## Analysis
The `SecureEnclaveModule.swift` file is actually **correct**. All functions use the proper pattern:

```swift
let workItem = DispatchWorkItem {
  // code here
}
DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async(execute: workItem)
```

This is the correct way to use `DispatchQueue.async` with a `DispatchWorkItem`.

## Root Cause
The error is likely due to:
1. **Xcode indexing cache** - Xcode may have stale index information
2. **Derived data** - Old build artifacts causing parser confusion
3. **Build cache** - Cached intermediate files with old syntax

## Solution Applied

1. **Cleaned build artifacts:**
   - Removed `ios/build`
   - Removed `ios/DerivedData`
   - Removed Xcode derived data in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/`

2. **Cleaned Xcode project:**
   - Ran `xcodebuild clean` on the workspace

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Rebuild in Xcode
1. **Close Xcode completely**
2. **Open Xcode again**
3. **Clean Build Folder**: `Product` → `Clean Build Folder` (or `Cmd + Shift + K`)
4. **Rebuild**: `Product` → `Build` (or `Cmd + B`)

### Option 2: Rebuild from Command Line
```bash
cd /Users/timiajeigbe/Documents/echoID/EchoID
npx react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone 15"
```

### Option 3: Reset Xcode Index
If error persists:
1. Close Xcode
2. Delete `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/EchoID-*`
3. Open Xcode again
4. Wait for indexing to complete
5. Build again

## Verification

The code is correct. After cleaning and rebuilding, the error should disappear. The syntax used in `SecureEnclaveModule.swift` is the standard and recommended pattern for async dispatch in Swift.

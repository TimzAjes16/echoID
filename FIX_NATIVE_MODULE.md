# Fix for RNGetRandomValues Native Module Error

## Problem
The `RNGetRandomValues` native module is not registered in the native binary, causing errors even though we have a fallback.

## Root Cause
The error occurs because:
1. `ethereum-cryptography` tries to use `crypto.getRandomValues` immediately when imported
2. If the native module isn't properly linked, it throws an error before our fallback can be used
3. The polyfill must be set up BEFORE any imports that use crypto

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced `index.js` Polyfill Setup
- **Critical Change**: Set up the polyfill FIRST, before trying to import the native module
- The polyfill is now always available, even if native module fails
- Native module will override the polyfill if it works, otherwise polyfill is used

### 2. Clean Rebuild Process
- Cleaned iOS build artifacts (`ios/build`, `ios/Pods`, `Podfile.lock`)
- Reinstalling pods to ensure proper linking
- This ensures all native modules are correctly registered

### 3. Fallback-First Approach
The new approach:
1. **Always set up polyfill first** (works in all cases)
2. **Then try native module** (overrides polyfill if available)
3. **If native fails**, polyfill is already there (no error)

## Next Steps

After pod install completes:

1. **Rebuild the app:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/timiajeigbe/Documents/echoID/EchoID
   npx react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone 15"
   ```

2. **Expected Behavior:**
   - If native module works: Uses native `RNGetRandomValues` (most secure)
   - If native module unavailable: Uses pure JS polyfill (works for development)
   - **No more errors** - polyfill is always available

## Verification

After rebuild, check console logs:
- ✅ "Pure JS crypto.getRandomValues polyfill installed (fallback)" - Always appears
- ✅ "react-native-get-random-values native module loaded" - Only if native works
- ⚠️ "react-native-get-random-values native module not available" - If using fallback

Either way, wallet creation should now work without errors!
